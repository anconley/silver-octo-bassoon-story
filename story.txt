A man named Tucker lived on top of a floating island, with the sea crashing on
 the surface below. He was an old fisherman, and he would ride an airship down
 to the ocean in order to obtain his supper. The man was lonely, but still
 content with a simple life.

On a rather frightening night Tucker became stranded in the open ocean. He was
forced to survive by manning his vessel against the torential winds of the sea.
With his only comapnion Wilson, a volleyball with a sharpie face, he managed to
navigate back to his home island and rest after conquering the sea.
