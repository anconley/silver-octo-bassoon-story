A man named Tucker lived on top of a floating island, with the sea crashing on
 the surface below. He was an old fisherman, and he would ride an airship down
 to the ocean in order to obtain his supper. The man was lonely, but still
 content with a simple life.

On a rather frightening night Tucker became stranded in the open ocean. He was
forced to survive by manning his vessel against the torential winds of the sea.
With his only comapnion Wilson, a volleyball with a sharpie face, he managed to
navigate back to his home island and rest after conquering the sea. 

But the story wasn't over yet so another adventure had to happen. Tucker
arrived at home but found himself bored of his simple life.

Unfortunatley, his wife kellen had moved on in his absence and remarried. Tucker, feeling over whemled and in shock, did not know where to go from here. But as long as his companion Wilson was with him, he knew that everything would be okay.

In fact, Tucker and Wilson ended up getting married, which at least made Tucker quite happy. With that, the two lived happily ever after on the floating island.
